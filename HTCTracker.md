# Pairing VIVE Tracker

Turn on controller devices first. Then, open Steam VR. You will see the controllers in SteamVR status.  

If Steam VR was launched already, then turn on controllers. The controllers should be automatically identified. Otherwise, do "Devices" -> "Pair Controller" in SteamVR Menu.
